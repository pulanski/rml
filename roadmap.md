# Roadmap

## Basic Language Features

### 1. Structured Data Types

- **Structs/Records:** Implement structures or records as compound data types that can hold data of different types. This includes syntax for defining structs, initializing them, and accessing their members.
- **Enums:** Add enumerated types with associated data (like in Rust), which are useful for representing a fixed set of possibilities.

### 2. Advanced Type System Features

- **Traits/Interfaces:** Implement traits (similar to Rust) or interfaces that define methods a type must implement, allowing for polymorphism and behavior abstraction.
- **Type Aliases:** Allow users to create aliases for existing types for readability and convenience.

### 3. Modularity and Code Organization

- **Modules/Namespace:** Implement a module or namespace system for better code organization, allowing for encapsulation and reusability of code.
- **Imports and Exports:** Define syntax for importing and exporting functions, types, and constants from modules.
- **Package System:** Develop a simple package system to manage dependencies and module versioning.

### 4. Compile-Time Features and Metaprogramming

- **Compile-Time Evaluation:** Introduce compile-time evaluation of expressions where possible, to optimize runtime performance.
- **Macros:** Implement macros that allow writing code that generates other code at compile time, enhancing the power of metaprogramming.
- **Attribute-Based Programming:** Introduce attributes or annotations that can be used to modify the behavior of the compiler or runtime for certain elements.

### 5. Functional Programming Constructs

- **Pattern Matching:** Enhance pattern matching, allowing for more expressive and concise ways to handle complex data types like enums and structs.
- **Higher-Order Functions:** Ensure first-class support for functions that can accept other functions as arguments or return them as results.
- **Immutability and Side-Effect Control:** Introduce language constructs to enforce or encourage immutability and control side effects, promoting functional programming paradigms.

### 6. Memory Management and Safety

- **Ownership and Borrowing:** Depending on the memory model, consider implementing an ownership and borrowing system (like Rust) to manage memory safely and efficiently.
- **Safe References and Pointers:** Introduce safe references and pointers, providing a way to point to memory locations without the usual risks associated with pointer arithmetic in languages like C.

### 7. Error Handling and Robustness

- **Advanced Error Handling:** Implement advanced error handling mechanisms, like `Result` types or `Option` types, for managing the presence or absence of values and handling errors in a more robust way.
- **Assertions and Contracts:** Provide built-in support for assertions and design-by-contract programming to ensure program correctness.

### 8. Concurrency and Parallelism Constructs

- **Async/Await:** Implement async/await syntax for easier handling of asynchronous operations.
- **Concurrency Primitives:** Introduce threads, mutexes, channels, etc., for concurrency management.
